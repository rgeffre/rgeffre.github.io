	<p>I have been an IT professional for the past 20 years, working in Technical Support and then moving into roles as a Senior Systems Engineer.  I became interested in computers in childhood, watching Star Trek.  My role model was Mr. Spock.  It took me some time to get where I wanted to be, but it has been a great journey and now I am taking the next step and learning how to program.</p>
